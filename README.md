What

The concept of Address in this project refers to the geographical address â€“ e.g. your house address, and various forms of it, including postal address, property address and so on.

In this project, I introduce a way of representing Address in a flexible manner using meta-data. Then I build the Address component based on this design using various technologies and frameworks.

Why

Address has been an integral part of many business IT systems in most fields/industries. However, majority of these IT systems do not model and implement Address in a portable and flexible way so that it can be used in different countries or regions and take on different formats and conventions of the country/locale.

This Address component adopts a meta-data approach to allow the Address formats and fields to be configurable.  The same Address component can accommodate multiple formats.

I wrote the Address component and various implementations of it as a way to learn and practice my programming skills using the underlying technologies and frameworks. After all, practice makes perfect. This document also serves as a reminder for myself about the lessons learned and experiences gained during this whole exercise.
